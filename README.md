## 🖥️ Browser Compatibility & Installation

Elden Email is designed to work not only on Chrome, but also on the most popular browsers thanks to their support for Chrome extensions and the WebExtensions standard.

### 🌐 Chrome
- **Recommended:** Search for “Elden Email” on the Chrome Web Store and install in one click.
- **Manual:** See instructions above, but the official store version is preferred for automatic updates.

### 🌀 Edge
- **Compatibility:** Microsoft Edge supports Chrome extensions almost 100%.
- **How to Install:**  
  - Visit [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons).
  - Search for “Elden Email” and install directly from the store.

### 🔴 Opera
- **Compatibility:** Opera supports Manifest V2/V3 extensions.
- **How to Install:**  
  - Go to [Opera Add-ons](https://addons.opera.com).
  - Search for “Elden Email” and install from the store.

### 🦊 Firefox
- **Compatibility:** Firefox uses the “WebExtensions” system, very similar to Chrome’s.  

- **How to Install from the Store:**  
  - Visit [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org).  
  - Search for “Elden Email” and install it directly from the store.  

- **How to Test or Build Locally:**  
  - Go to the `src/` folder of the project (this contains all source files).  
  - Copy all files into a new folder `dist/firefox/`.  
  - Rename `manifest_firefox.json` to `manifest.json`.  
  - Create a ZIP of **all files inside** `dist/firefox/` (do **not** zip the `firefox/` folder itself).  
  - Open Firefox → `about:debugging` → “This Firefox” → “Load Temporary Add-on” → select the `manifest.json` inside your ZIP or folder.  
  - Test the extension: the banner should appear when sending an email; the popup may not save preferences yet.  

- **Publishing Notes:**  
  - Some APIs differ (`chrome.*` → `browser.*`).  
  - Images must be listed in `web_accessible_resources` with a slightly different format.  
  - You may need [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) for Firefox compatibility.  
  - Provide source code and a README explaining the build process when submitting to Mozilla.  
  - Consult the [MDN migration guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Chrome_incompatibilities) if you encounter errors.  


### 🦁 Brave, Vivaldi, and other Chromium Browsers
- **Compatibility:** Full support for Chrome extensions.
- **How to Install:**  
  - Search for “Elden Email” on the Chrome Web Store and install directly.
  - No manual installation required.


> **Note:**  
> For all supported browsers, once the extension is published in their respective stores, you should always install it from the official store to receive updates and the best experience.  
> Manual installation via ZIP is only recommended for development or testing and does **not** provide automatic updates.
